## UV-vis under tensile strain
This repo is for storage and analysis of  polarized UVvis data of conjgated polmyer thin films. 

### Baseline Correction Method
The Absorbance of the polarizer was measured in both positions (0 and 90 degrees). The transmitance was calculated as (1-Absorbance). It is assume this is the transfer function for light intensity as function of wavelength, and we wish to undo its effects. Thus we divide the final measure transmittance by the tranmittance of the polarizer, and this should give us the transmittance of the sample.

### Dichroic Ratio [TODO]
The ratio of $A_{||}/A_‚ä•$ is taken at the $A_{0-0}$ (620nm) and $A_{0-1}$ (560 nm) peaks.
