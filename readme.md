## UV-vis under tensile strain
This repo is for storage and analysis of  polarized UVvis data of conjgated polmyer thin films. 

### Absorption ratio
The ratio $A_{0-0}/A_{0-1}$ is taken


### Dichroic Ratio [TODO]
The ratio of $A_{||}/A_‚ä•$ is taken at the $A_{0-0}$ (620nm) and $A_{0-1}$ (560 nm) peaks.
